# Build and run a container image with Azure Container Registry Tasks

In this exercise, you build a container image from your application code and push it to Azure Container Registry using Azure CLI. You learn how to prepare your app for containerization, create an ACR instance, and store your container image in Azure.

Tasks performed in this exercise:

* Create an Azure Container Registry resource
* Build and push an image from a Dockerfile
* Verify the results
* Run the image in the Azure Container Registry

This exercise takes approximately **20** minutes to complete.

## Create an Azure Container Registry resource

1. In your browser navigate to the Azure portal [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com); signing in with your Azure credentials if prompted.

1. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new cloud shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***Bash*** environment. The cloud shell provides a command line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal.

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *PowerShell* environment, switch it to ***Bash***.

1. Create a resource group for the resources needed for this exercise. Replace **myResourceGroup** with a name you want to use for the resource group. You can replace **eastus** with a region near you if needed. If you already have a resource group you want to use, proceed to the next step.

    ```
    az group create --location eastus --name myResourceGroup
    ```

1. Run the following command to create a basic container registry. The registry name must be unique within Azure, and contain 5-50 alphanumeric characters. Replace **myResourceGroup** with the name you used earlier, and **myContainerRegistry** with a unique value.

    ```bash
    az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --name myContainerRegistry --sku Basic
    ```

    > **Note:** The command creates a *Basic* registry, a cost-optimized option for developers learning about Azure Container Registry.

## Build and push an image from a Dockerfile

Next, you build and push an image based on a Dockerfile.

1. Run the following command to create the Dockerfile. The Dockerfile contains a single line that references the *hello-world* image hosted at the Microsoft Container Registry.

    ```bash
    echo FROM mcr.microsoft.com/hello-world > Dockerfile
    ```

1. Run the following **az acr build** command, which builds the image and, after the image is successfully built, pushes it to your registry. Replace **myContainerRegistry** with the name you created earlier.

    ```bash
    az acr build --image sample/hello-world:v1  \
        --registry myContainerRegistry \
        --file Dockerfile .
    ```

    Following is a shortened sample of the output from the previous command showing the last few lines with the final results. You can see in the *repository* field the *sample/hello-word* image is listed.

    ```
    - image:
        registry: myContainerRegistry.azurecr.io
        repository: sample/hello-world
        tag: v1
        digest: sha256:92c7f9c92844bbbb5d0a101b22f7c2a7949e40f8ea90c8b3bc396879d95e899a
      runtime-dependency:
        registry: mcr.microsoft.com
        repository: hello-world
        tag: latest
        digest: sha256:92c7f9c92844bbbb5d0a101b22f7c2a7949e40f8ea90c8b3bc396879d95e899a
      git: {}
    
    
    Run ID: cf1 was successful after 11s
    ```

## Verify the results

1. Run the following command to list the repositories in your registry. Replace **myContainerRegistry** with the name you created earlier.

    ```bash
    az acr repository list --name myContainerRegistry --output table
    ```

    Output:

    ```
    Result
    ----------------
    sample/hello-world
    ```

1. Run the following command to list the tags on the **sample/hello-world** repository. Replace **myContainerRegistry** with the name you used earlier.

    ```bash
    az acr repository show-tags --name myContainerRegistry \
        --repository sample/hello-world --output table
    ```

    Output:

    ```
    Result
    --------
    v1
    ```

## Run the image in the ACR

1. Run the *sample/hello-world:v1* container image from your container registry with the **az acr run** command. The following example uses **$Registry** to specify the registry where you run the command. Replace **myContainerRegistry** with the name you used earlier.

    ```bash
    az acr run --registry myContainerRegistry \
        --cmd '$Registry/sample/hello-world:v1' /dev/null
    ```

    The **cmd** parameter in this example runs the container in its default configuration, but **cmd** supports other **docker run** parameters or even other **docker** commands. 

    The following sample output is shortened:

    ```

## Clean up resources

Now that you finished the exercise, you should delete the cloud resources you created to avoid unnecessary resource usage.

1. Navigate to the resource group you created and view the contents of the resources used in this exercise.
1. On the toolbar, select **Delete resource group**.
1. Enter the resource group name and confirm that you want to delete it.

> **CAUTION:** Deleting a resource group deletes all resources contained within it. If you chose an existing resource group for this exercise, any existing resources outside the scope of this exercise will also be deleted.
